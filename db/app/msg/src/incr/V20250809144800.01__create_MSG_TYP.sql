/**
This type stores (meta-)information about a message. It is intended as a
generic type that can be used in Oracle Advanced Queueing (AQ).

The group$ will then be used as a queue name (with dots replaced by dollars).

We want to support buffered messages in AQ since it is fast (keeps things in
memory) and then you can not use not null LOBs since the Oracle AQ
documentation states this about enqueuing buffered messages: the queue type
for buffered messaging can be ADT, XML, ANYDATA, or RAW. For ADT types with
LOB attributes, only buffered messages with null LOB attributes can be
enqueued.

Therefore there are some member functions that determine whether a type may
have not null LOBs or a specific object may have them.

The created$ attribute is not a TIMESTAMP [ WITH [ LOCAL ] TIME ZONE ] since
that may pose problems later on.

This procedure is there since Oracle Object Types do not allow to invoke a

type constructor like this:

(self as msg_typ).construct(p_group$, p_context$);

This procedure also sets created$ to the system timestamp as a string using oracle_tools.api_time_pkg.timestamp2str().

, member procedure process
  ( self in msg_typ
  , p_maybe_later in integer default 1 -- True (1) or false (0)
  )
/**
This is the main routine that determines whether to (finally) process a message.

Assuming that you use AQ (MSG_AQ_PKG) like this super type, these are the outcomes:
- not now (and not later), if self.must_be_processed(p_maybe_later) <> 1
- later, if self.must_be_processed(p_maybe_later) = 1 and you invoke self.process$later
- now, if self.must_be_processed(p_maybe_later) = 1 and you invoke self.process$now

This is the default implementation which postpones the actual work:

```
  if self.must_be_processed(p_maybe_later) = 1
  then
    case p_maybe_later
      when 1 then self.process$later;
      when 0 then self.process$now;
    end case;
  end if;
```

Assuming that you use AQ (MSG_AQ_PKG), the call self.process(1) must be
invoked when the message has just been created (for instance in a trigger),
meaning it will be enqueued for later processing.  When dequeued the call
self.process(0) should be invoked to do the actual job. Then
MSG_AQ_PKG.DEQUEUE_PROCESS will invoke self.process(0) for you.  You may
decide to override this in a subtype to force immediate processing like this:

```
  if self.must_be_processed(p_maybe_later) = 1
  then
    case p_maybe_later
      when 1 then self.process$now;
    end case;
  end if;
```

only to process messages that are interesting: you do NOT want to decrease
performance by queueing messages you will never process, don't you?  The next
thing is that messages may be not interesting later on (p_maybe_later =
0) due to elapsed time or some other reason.
