Package to give a rough estimate of the elapsed time in seconds and fractional seconds.
The granularity is what is returned by dbms_utility.get_time, i.e hundredths of seconds.

Notes:
1. the SYS_EXTRACT_UTC() returns a value with datatype TIMESTAMP, not TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE. So do NOT use that.
2. SYSTIMESTAMP() and CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() have datatype TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE.

/**
Determines the elapsed time in seconds (not hundredths of seconds!) between two measure points taken by get_time(), the start (earlier) and the end (later).

The function dbms_utility.get_time returns the number of hundredths of a second from the point in time at which the subprogram is invoked.

Numbers are returned in the range -2147483648 to 2147483647 depending on
platform and machine, and your application must take the sign of the number
into account in determining the interval. For instance, in the case of two
negative numbers, application logic must allow that the first (earlier) number
will be larger than the second (later) number which is closer to zero. By the
same token, your application should also allow that the first (earlier) number
be negative and the second (later) number be positive.
