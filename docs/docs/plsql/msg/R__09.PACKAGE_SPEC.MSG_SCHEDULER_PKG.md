# Package "MSG_SCHEDULER_PKG"

Package to (re)start, stop or drop the process that will process the groups for which the default processing method is "package://<schema>.MSG_SCHEDULER_PKG"
and whose queue is NOT registered as a PL/SQL callback "plsql://<schema>.MSG_NOTIFICATION_PRC".

## Procedure do

Runs in an autonomous transaction.

This procedure should be used to manage the jobs instead of directly calling DBMS_SCHEDULER.

p_command = create / drop:
- Create or drop all the scheduler objects like jobs, programs, schedules.
- Worker jobs are not created though since they need to be created by the launcher job.

p_command = start:
- Check that there are no jubs running (equivalent to do('check-jobs-not-running')).
- Start the launcher job (submit_processing_launcher()) if it does not exist,
  otherwise disable and enable (i.e. start).

p_command = shutdown:
- Gracefuly stop all the running jobs launched by this package.
- Check that there are no jubs running (equivalent to do('check-jobs-not-running')).

p_command = stop:
- Stop all the running jobs launched by this package.
- Check that there are no jubs running (equivalent to do('check-jobs-not-running')).

p_command = restart:
- Stop and start, equivalent to do('stop') followed by do('start').

p_command = check-jobs-running / check-jobs-not-running:
- Check that there are (no) running jobs that have been started by this package. If so, an error is raised.

SIGNATURE

```sql
procedure do
( p_command in varchar2 -- create / drop / start / shutdown / stop / restart / check-jobs-running / check-jobs-not-running
, p_processing_package in varchar2 default '%' -- find packages like this paramater that have both a routine get_groups_to_process() and processing()
);
```


## Procedure submit_processing_launcher

Submits the launcher, see processing_launcher() below, that will submit the supervisor and its workers and then finish.

SIGNATURE

```sql
procedure submit_processing_launcher
( p_processing_package in varchar2
, p_nr_workers_each_group in positive default msg_constants_pkg.get_nr_workers_each_group
, p_nr_workers_exact in positive default msg_constants_pkg.get_nr_workers_exact
);
```


## Procedure processing_launcher

This procedure is meant to be used by DBMS_SCHEDULER jobs or for test
purposes, never use it in application code: use 
submit_processing_launcher() above!

So the administrator should NEVER create a job based on this procedure.

It is a launcher routine that just launches other jobs, the workers and a
supervisor.  The launcher then finishes since the supervisor restarts failing
or stopped workers. Now the recurring schedule of the launcher job (for
instance each day) will start this launcher process again and again just
launching the supervisor and workers.  The idea is to use resources efficient
by running for a long period with some concurrent worker jobs but not to
exhaust system resources due to processes that run forever and that do not
correctly clean up resources.

Exactly one of the following parameters must be set:
1. p_nr_workers_each_group: the number of workers is then the number of groups found to be processed multiplied by this number
2. p_nr_workers_exact: the number of workers is this number

The processing package must have this routine that will be invoked by dynamic SQL:

```
function get_groups_to_process
( p_processing_method in varchar2
)
return sys.odcivarchar2list;
```

This will determine the groups to process, after which the supervisor and workers will do the
actual work based on that information.

SIGNATURE

```sql
procedure processing_launcher
( p_processing_package in varchar2
, p_nr_workers_each_group in positive default msg_constants_pkg.get_nr_workers_each_group
, p_nr_workers_exact in positive default msg_constants_pkg.get_nr_workers_exact
);
```


## Procedure processing

This procedure is meant to be used by (indirectly) DBMS_SCHEDULER jobs, not by YOU!

So the administrator should NEVER create a job based on this procedure.

This is the worker routine, started as a job by processing_launcher(). 

The processing package must have this routine that will be invoked by dynamic SQL:

```
procedure processing
( p_controlling_package in varchar2 -- the controlling package, i.e. the one who invoked this procedure
, p_groups_to_process_tab in sys.odcivarchar2list -- the groups to process
, p_worker_nr in positiven -- the worker number: null for supervisor
, p_end_date in timestamp with time zone -- the end date
, p_silence_threshold in number
);
```

This will do the processing of all messages till the end is reached or an exception occurs.

SIGNATURE

```sql
procedure processing
( p_processing_package in varchar2
, p_groups_to_process_list in varchar2 -- a comma separated list of groups to process
, p_nr_workers in positiven -- the number of workers
, p_worker_nr in positive -- the worker number: null for supervisor
, p_end_date in varchar2 -- the end date (as string)
);
```
